# Prefect minimal setup

While finding out about Prefect, I found that the documentation is a bit overwhelming for beginners. The example setups are either very barebones or very complex. So I created this minimal setup that is easy to understand and seems to me as the minial way to run prefect in production: 1 orchestrator and 1 worker container, running all the flows.
